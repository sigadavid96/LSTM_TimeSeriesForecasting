# Time Series Forecasting through LSTM on Apple's Stock Prices 

>Time Series Forecasting is a highly popular technique for predicting and planning demand/resources over time.

>Stock Price prediction is a popular problem and in this tutorial i plan to showcase how to do time series forecasting using Deep Learning methods.

>PyTorch can be overwhelming and hence I plan to explain the usage in an easy going way to first timers.


# Introduction & Motivation

Have you ever wondered how Stock Market Traders use historical time series stock data to make profits?

Time Series Forecasting is one of the most prominent prediction approach taken towards making investment decisions in the Stock Market Trading by independent traders or the Big Financial Institutions.

[Google AI's Research](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/12/interpretable-deep-learning-for-time.html#:~:text=Deep%20neural%20networks%20(DNNs)%20have,over%20traditional%20time%20series%20models.) tells us that Deep Neural Networks have started taking over the Traditional Time Series Forecasting Methods.

This tutorial will introduce you to Long short-term memory, one of the prominent deep learning methods used for Time Series Forecasting.

ARIMA, a prominent Traditional Time Series Forecasting method with great results in the past.
[IEEE Research](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10186768) shows that 
LSTM significantly beats ARIMA on Financial Data and more.

This Tutorial will help you code and experimentally analyze,model, and evaluate how well LSTM could perform on real world time series data from
